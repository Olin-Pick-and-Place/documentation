First meeting after hearing back about the grant.

We discussed the differences and viability of a manual pick and place versus an automatic one. The system we decided on was a manual-first system that includes a guidance system (like the one [here](https://vimeo.com/318724258). This will allow for full flexibility.

To begin, James will work on cadding the 2 axis system with a possible third axis in the form of a raisable bed for the PCB (this is mostly for the solder paste extrusion). Jack and others will work on prototyping circuitry for the head, including pneumatics, camera, and mechanical motion (rotating the head of the needle). Once prototypes are done, we will work with James to develop an enclosure that works well with the 2 axis system and begin manufacturing. After basic manual systems are in place, we will work on the semi-automatic eye-guide as seen in the video linked above. This is where most of the software will come into play.

Next steps:                    
* CAD for 2-axis system        
* Start prototyping the circuit for the head (including the pump) and purchase a pump and possibly valve
